Capstone Project Codecademy Build Websites from Scratch
I choose the colors using a website called coolors.co that lets you upload a photo. I choose the first photo and found an option that I liked.
I used these colors for the backgrounds and some of the font colors.
I looked at google fonts for fonts that looked modern to me, I choose non-serif fonts for this reason. I only used 2 because that looked
the most cohesive. I didn't want to clutter the website with a lot of fonts.
Because there are no actual links on the page I used hover and transistion properties to create an effect when a "link" is hovered over.
I did find 2 FontAwesome Icons for the Footer, but felt like any more would clutter up the page.
I did try to make the page accessible for screen readers, but both links in the lesson don't work anymore. (I tried to report a bug but 
the button didn't do anything) So I just re-did the lesson again and tried to apply that to this site.
Thank you!
